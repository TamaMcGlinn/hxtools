Syntax: tailhex [-B bytes] [-e start] [-Qaf] FILE

  -B bytes       Buffer and window width
  -Q             Use 64-bit pos numbers beginning from 0
  -a             Approximate position start
  -e start       Exact position start (64-bit max)
  -f             Retry at EOF (tail follow mode)

About the same as `od -x`, but with 64-bit support, readable printout and
tail following.
