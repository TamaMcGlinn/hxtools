Usage: bsvplay [-q part] [-i part] [-r rate] [FILE...} |
       oplay -Ms48000 -

  -q part        part to mix square waves in (default: 1.0)
  -i part        part to mix sine waves in (default: 1.0)
  -r rate        sample rate (default: 48000 Hz)

bsvplay will convert BASICA binary music files to linear 16-bit PCM (not .wav,
but raw). By default, it will mix 1:1 square:sine waves to give a medium tone
hardness.

The BASICA format is defined 6-byte tuples of divisor, duration and pause.

	struct bsv_insn {
		uint16_t divisor;
		uint16_t duration; /* in ticks */
		uint16_t af_pause; /* in ticks */
	};

where divisor specifies the divisor value that it directly handed to the x86 PC
speaker. The following formula holds:

	frequency = 1193181 / divisor;

I am currently investigating more about the BASICA format as I have just
(August 2007) found some very intersting sources from 1984 that even predate
the BSV sample files I had from 1989.
