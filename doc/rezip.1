.SH Description
.PP
rezip recompresses ZIP archives (including those disguised as JAR,
and OpenDocuments), PNG and JPEG images with maximum lossless
compression settings. It is used to improve on files which have
originally only compressed with default settings, which are usually
lower than maximum.
.SH Options
.PP
rezip takes directory names or ZIP archives as input. Passing a file
object that is not ZIP is not supported and will leave that file
unprocessed.
