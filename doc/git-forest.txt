Usage: git-forest [--style=N] [--sha] [REVLISTOPTIONS] [REFSPEC...]

--style=1
	Use single-line visuals
--style=2
	Use double-line visuals (default)
--style=3
	Use single-line visuals in vertical direction,
	and double-line ones in horizontal direction.
--sha
	Display SHAs for each commit

All other options and arguments are passed down to git-log.
Commonly useful options are --all and --topo-order.

Example:
	git-forest --all | less -RS
	git-forest origin/master | less -RS

This tool does not try to minimize the empty space between branches
like gitk does. Take it as a feature.

Notes on interpretation:

Connections with four "legs" ('╬' or variants thereof, like '╪') are
meant to be interpreted as being connected only in the horizontal and
vertical direction, NOT around-the-corner.

Connections with three or less "legs" ('╠', '╩', '╦', etc.) imply
a connection to all connected directions.
