The german magazine "Linux USER" 06/2003, p. 76 shows a way to implement a
faster cd, but since I rarely have trees that are /that/ parallel like shown
in the article (i.e. /usr/src/stable/projectname/src/main.c and
/usr/src/unstable/projectname/src/main.c), so I decided to write my own
cd AI.

UP   -> en direction to the root directory
DOWN -> en direction to the current directory's childs

The algorithm can be summarized as: try each directory depth level interleaved
in downwards and upwards order and change to a directory if a match is found.

In detail: Let's say we are in /usr/src/linux-2.6 and want to cd to "sbin".
longjumpcd will try these paths in that order:

        Directory                                       Depth change
        /usr/src/linux-2.6/sbin                         (+0)
        /usr/src/sbin                                   (-1)
        /usr/src/linux-2.6/Documentation/sbin           (+1)
        /usr/src/linux-2.6/arch/sbin                    (+1)
        /usr/src/linux-2.6/crypto/sbin                  (+1)
        ...
        /usr/src/linux-2.6/usr/sbin                     (+1)
        /usr/sbin                                       (-2)
        /usr/src/linux-2.6/Documentation/BK-usage/sbin  (+2)
        /usr/src/linux-2.6/Documentation/DocBook/sbin   (+2)
        ...
        /usr/src/linux-2.6/arch/alpha/sbin              (+2)
        /usr/src/linux-2.6/arch/arm/sbin                (+2)
        ...
        /sbin                                           (-3)

and so forth. That is, it tries to find a match with the least depth change
possible. Note that you can not reach e.g. /usr/local/sbin from
/usr/src/linux-2.6, because it would require a direction change from up to
down somewhere in between. This is not part of my idea nor the algorithm.

The current directory is not taken into consideration (verified by inode
number), e.g.:

        /usr/src/linux-2.6 $ longjumpcd-bin linux-2.6;

will fail (in fact, _shall_ fail) unless there is a directory above linux-2.6
that is called linux-2.6.

The longjumpcd-bin only prints the directory on stdout, because the shell which
called us will have to change its working directory. This leaves room for more
extensions. (E.g. function xd() { pushd `longjumpcd-bin $1`; })
