Syntax: omixer [device] [control [volume]]

  device      The path to the mixer device, prefix it with a equalSign
              sign "=/dev/mixer1" for example. You can abbreviate
              that into ":1" (for mixer1)

  control     Control to examine (dependant on mixer device)
              If "?r", prints the recording source(s),
              (de)select it with "+r" / "-r"

  volume      The volume level to set (otherwise display level)

Control volume of OSS-compliant devices.

Examples:
  Show all controls:
       omixer
  Show all controls of /dev/mixer1:
       omixer =/dev/mixer1
  (or) omixer :1
  Show PCM control of mixer0:
       omixer pcm
  Set PCM to 50% left, 70% right:
       omixer pcm 50:70
  Set PCM on /dev/mixer2 to 50% both
       omixer :2 pcm 50



Syntax: oplay [-B blksize] [-K bytepos] [-M] [-T bytelim] [-V level]
              [-b smpsize] [-c channels] [-d device][...] [-f fragsize]
              [-k timepos] [-q] [-s smprate] [-t timelim] [-v] [-w] FILE[...]

  -B | --blksize     Sets the block size (bytes to r/w at ocne)
  -K | --pos=pos     Jump to position (bytes)
  -M | --mono        Sets the mono flag; equivalent to -c1
  -Q | --quad        Sets 4 channel output; equivalent to -c4
  -T | --limit       Maximum amount of bytes to record/play
  -V                 Set verbosity level (default: 3)
  -b | --smpsize     Sets the sample size (8/16 bit) (default: 16)
  -c | --channels    Sets the number of channels (default: 2)
  -d | --device      Uses this DSP device (default: /dev/dsp)
  -f | --fragsize    Sets the fragment size
  -k                 Jump to position (minutes:seconds)
  -q | --quiet       Lower verbosity level
  -s | --smprate     Set the samplerate (default: 44100)
  -t | --limit       Maximum amount of time to record/play
  -v | --verbose     Raise verbosity level


Play the specified files using the given parameters.

Verbosity levels:
  0    no output at all
  1    just print the filename
  2    filename + a dot for each block that was written to the DSP device
  3    filename + time position
  4    filename + time position + byte position



Syntax: orec (same as above) FILE[...]

  The same options as above apply. -K and -k are ignored NOT for orec,
  instead, that many seconds/bytes are seeked into before recording.
  If no -K or -k is specified, the file is truncated first. (Due to open())

  -Q/-c4 might yield weird results if the underlying device does not
  support it.

Records from the DSP device to a file.
