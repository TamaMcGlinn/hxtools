Syntax: utmp_register [-ADUWe] [-h host] [-l user] [-t tty] [-p id1] [-s id2]
                      [-u utmpfile] [-w wtmpfile]

  -A            Add entry
  -D            Delete entry
  -U            Perform operation on UTMP
  -W            Perform operation on WTMP
  -e            Encode PID into ut_id
  -h host       Host field
  -l user       User field
  -t tty        TTY field
  -p pid        Unique ID 1
  -s session    Unique ID 2
  -u file       Path to utmp, defaults to /var/run/utmp
  -w file       Path to wtmp, defaults to /var/log/wtmp

-A and -D can be specified together, in which case an entry is added and
instantly removed again (utmp), or a login of duration zero (wtmp).

This is a helper program for programs which do not want to do the UTMP/WTMP
handling within themselves.
