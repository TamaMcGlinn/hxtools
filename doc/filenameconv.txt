Usage: filenameconv [-Y] -f FROMCHARSET -t TOCHARSET DIRECTORY...

  -f FROMCHARSET    The charset which your files are currently in
  -t TOCHARSET      The charset you want to have the files afterwards
  -Y                Process the files instead of showing what would be done

Convert filenames on the whole filesystem between two charsets.
The selected charsets must be supported by the `iconv` program!

Example:
    filenameconv -f iso-8859-1 -t utf-8 .
