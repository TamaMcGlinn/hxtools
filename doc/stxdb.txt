Syntax: stxdb [-A dir] [-M] [-S] [-V volid] [-W] [-a] [-f file] [-l] [-o opt]

  -A dir      Directory which should be added to the database
  -M          Mount the directory given by -A before adding
  -S          Save the database
  -V volid    Tag the directory with volid in the database
  -W          Show database
  -a          Show only artists
  -f file     Use specified file as database
  -l          Show only albums
  -o opt      Set arbitrary option

The options may seem weird, because they are flags, not commands. This means
that the order of execution is always "Load database", "Add directory", "Save
database", "Show database". You just specify _which_ of these you want to run,
and if it's all four.

Examples for common operations:

  Adding a CD to the database, using -M to make stxdb mount it
      stxdb -A /mnt -MSV "Private Collection CD #34"

  Adding a directory (w/o mount!)
      stxdb -A /bla/dir -SV "Private Collection CD #35"

  Show database
      stxdb -W

  Rebuild database
      stxdb -S
