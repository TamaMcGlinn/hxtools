== VC FONTS ==
The .fnt files are to be used for the virtual console (vc, also known as
/dev/tty1 ... tty6). Use `setfont xxx.fnt` to load a file. If you are using an
UTF-8 enabled vc, use `setfont xxx.fnt -u cp437`. Because FNT files do not come
with a unicode map, you have to provide one. Because most of these fonts are
ripped from VGA ROMs, they are CP437.

SUSE users:
If you load this font on boot-up, i.e. you entered it into CONSOLE_FONT in
/etc/sysconfig/console, you also have to set CONSOLE_UNICODEMAP to "cp437".


== X FONTS ==
The .bdf are plaitext X font files ("Bitmap Distribution Format"). They will
need to be converted to .pcf ("Portable Compiled Format"). The PCF files are
automatically generated by `make`. Afterwards, the PCF files can directly be
used for the X server.

If you want to manually install it, convert them using `bdftopcf` and
put the pcf file into the appropriate directory (/usr/share/fonts/misc).


== KEYBOARD MAPS ==
The .map files are (additional!) keyboard maps. They build up upon certain
keyboard definitions from the "kbd" package and make some more keys available.
If you want to load one at boot-up, use KEYTABLE in /etc/sysconfig/keyboard.
