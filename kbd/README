== VC FONTS ==

The .fnt files are to be used for the virtual console (vc, also known as
/dev/tty1 ... tty63). These raw font files come without an explicit
Unicode map, and are commonly using a cp437 mapping. Use

	setfont xxx.fnt -u /usr/share/kbd/unimaps/cp437.uni

to load it.


== SUSE users ==

You can edit /etc/sysconfig/console and set CONSOLE_FONT to the desired
font and CONSOLE_UNICODEMAP to /usr/share/kbd/unimaps/cp437.uni.


== X FONTS ==

The .bdf are plaintext X font files ("Bitmap Distribution Format"). They
will need to be converted to .pcf ("Portable Compiled Format"). The PCF
files are automatically generated by `make`. Afterwards, the PCF files
can directly be used for and by the X server.

The recommended font path is /usr/share/fonts/misc. Use of the `fxterm`
wrapper utility in bin/ is preferred to correctly display boldface in
xterm before version 254.


== KEYBOARD MAPS ==

The .map files are (additional!) keyboard maps. They build up upon
certain keyboard definitions from the "kbd" package and make some more
keys available. If you want to load one at boot-up in openSUSE, use
KEYTABLE in /etc/sysconfig/keyboard.

== FONT OVERVIEW ==

Unless otherwise noted,
 - the font glyph cells are 8 pixels wide and 16 pixels high
 - the actual font glyphs may use all of these 8 pixels
 - the fonts were designed for a 9 pixel wide character cell
   (IBM-style text mode, where the 9th column is a clone of
   the 8th for positions 0xB0-0xDF, and otherwise blank)

Linux fbdev makes the character cells as big as the glyph cells,
which may make some fonts look squashed together.
The vfontas(1) tool may be used to convert an 8x16 font to a 9x16
font, IBM-style, for use with fbdev.
